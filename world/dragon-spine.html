            <h3>What is the Dragon’s Spine?</h3>
            <p>
              The Dragon’s Spine extends almost entirely vertically for the vast majority of its area(which is only about 25 square km). 
              Perched amongst it's precipitous peaks lie impenetrable forests, impossibly draughty castles, serene monasteries, deep mines, and tiny cozy thatched cottages in which nothing suspicious happens.
              Due to the extreme altitude and the peculiarities of the local geography, a lot of these communities are built quite literally on top of each other, which results in some rather controversial mapmaking and a few very confusing wars.
