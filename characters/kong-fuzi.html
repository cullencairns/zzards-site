            <h3>Origin Story</h3>
            <p>High The Dragon’s Spine, in a place where the stones reflect upon themselves and silence is considered to be a bit attention-seeking is perched an unsurprisingly beige monastery. The monks living amongst its sober peaks practice the long pauses between thoughts from an early age.</p>
              
            <p>Our hero swiftly surpassed his tutors, showing little interest in effort, preferring stillness to strife, and rest to repetition, as if he trusted the world to move without his intervention. Some called this laziness. Others suspected it was something else entirely. He learned what he needed to learn, though never in a hurry.</p>

              <p>Now he is leaving the Dragon's Spine for the city below. Whether he goes seeking purpose or avoiding it is unclear. He carries no possessions, no explanations, only an unnervingly confident smile.</p>
