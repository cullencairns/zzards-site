            <p>
              Bright-eyed, soft-spoken, and hard-edged. She's gorgeous in any light, and is very aware of it. Has never done a page of homework, nor carried a single book to class.
              She'll steal your heart, parade it around town, and then return it in a condition that is simultaneously exactly as she left it, and irreparably shattered.

            <h3>Origin Story</h3>
            <p>
              When the Mother found the Maiden and the time was right she brought her into the deep woods to take counsel from the Crone.
              There, amongst the ancient woods the Maiden learned the ways of the forest, the night, and the ways of making men do her will.
            </p>
            <p>
              There comes a time when the Mother and the Crone must step back and let her find her own way. The Maiden is resourceful and inventive, and full of her own ideas. 
              She's ready for the next step in her development.
            </p>
            <p>
              So she's left the woods, and is out wandering the world, gathering and discarding allies and enemies as her whims and the fates decide.
