            <h3>Origin Story</h3>
            <p>
              The Reaper is the personification of that which follows from life. He is the debt collector, not the auditor. He does not come with judgment, but with a bill.
            </p>
            <p>
              He stands taller than any man I've ever known, his cloaked figure stoic against an ever-present wind. His eye sockets glow with a steady blue spark, his polished skull glistens against the shining light of eternity.
            </p>
            <p>
              One man has defied him, a Wizard of no real power who just does not seem capable of dying at the appropriate time. 
            </p><p>
              At this point the Reaper is starting to think that Fate wants him to take things into his own hands. It's not good for anyone to be alive for that long.
