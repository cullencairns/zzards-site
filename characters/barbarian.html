            <h3>Origin Story</h3>
            <p>
              When he was young, the Barbarian fought for glory and gold. When he got glory and riches, he fought for the reputation necessary to keep them.
              Now no one will fight him, and he considers that unfair, maidenless, and ultimately pointless since he doesn't mind doing a bit of traveling.
            </p>
            <p>
              He's fought dragons, demigods, and bureaucrats, and never lost a fight he cared about. As time wore on his odor grew to match his reputation and temperament, and a few of his dead ancestors(who still owed him a bit of money) managed to convince Death himself to leave the Barbarian be for the time being.
            </p>
            <p>
              So he roams the city looking for adventure: a rival soon-to-be-in distress, a lady of questionable virtue, or a tavern that serves ale strong enough to subdue his scent long enough for him to sneak away.
