            <h3>Who is The Wizard?</h3>
            <p>
              A rather hapless, self-alleged(and as yet unevidenced) master of the arcane. Uncommonly attached to his Hat, which he insists is "vital to the proper channeling of magical energies."

            <h3>Origin Story</h3>
            <p>
              The Wizard is one of name only, or at least that's the opinion of the general public(and the available evidence). It's unclear why he is allowed to use the title without repercussion.
            </p>
            <p>
              He is well known for his rapid exits, usually followed closely by curses and thrown objects. His time came up years ago, but he seems remarkably capable when it comes to dodging fate.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite all evidence to the contrary, the Wizard insists that he has control of the situation.
