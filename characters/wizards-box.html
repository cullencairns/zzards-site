            <p>
              A travelling chest with opinions, agency, and a need for personal space. Can allegedly do anything, but appears to specialize in playing Solitaire.

            <h3>Origin Story</h3>
            <p>
              The Box is the Wizard's best and only real claim to the arcane. Made of an unknown, but apparently autonomous kind of wood, it defends the Wizard with the dogged loyalty of a particularly protective badger.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Box doesn't seem to mind it's servitude, rather cherishing the opportunity to be useful. It occasionally needs to be kicked repeatedly, something the Wizard calls "rebooting".
            </p>
            <p>
              It isn't fortune, or fame that has driven the Box out of his usual dry closet, but rather a need to protect his companion from the elements.
