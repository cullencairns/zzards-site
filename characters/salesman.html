            <h3>Origin Story</h3>
            <p>
              The Salesman doesn't need much but a ware to dispense and the sincerely held belief that everyone needs what he's selling. Sausages make for the worst salesmen, their ingredients are questionable, the general hygiene of the stall is dubious at best, and the customers desperate enough to buy such a product are often woe to do anything but finish it as quickly as humanly possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              So he's found a dead pig, fresh enough that a local butcher was willing to grind it for a couple of marks, and now he's set up shop wherever he can get away with it.
            </p>
            <p>
              His sausages are starting to move, he's found some regulars, and he's starting to wonder whether to expand his territory and open another stall.

            <p><strong>Always. Be. Selling. Score if your hand contains none of The Sausage Salesman's Base Function Cards.</strong></p>

              Face Cards don’t count towards the win condition.

                Be wary of overextending your hand. You only get so many discards and so many plays. Don't wind up with extra Sausages in your hand.
