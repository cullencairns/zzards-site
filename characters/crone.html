              She is old in the way a forest is old: patient, watchful, and not especially impressed by you.

            <p>
              As the tales go, all Crones were once Mothers(or at least Maidens with a decent knowledge of preventative herbs). Deep in the forests, they're the last resort for the needy,
              the desperate, or the foolish. They brew tea, concoct potions, and do their best to stay out of politics.
            </p>
            <p>
              The truth is that she has been around long enough that no one remembers when she wasn't. It's not a question of when she came to the forest as much as it is a question of when the forest grew around her.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now she wanders into games the way fog wanders into valleys: quietly, inevitably,
              and with a faint sense that you aren't fully in control.
