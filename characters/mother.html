            <p>
              All Mothers are born as Maidens, typically from other Mothers. They learn their craft early, and hone it on unsuspecting, over-willing young gentlemen in dappled glades and daydreams.
              Eventually they get bored of this and decide to raise children. This Mother was no different.

            <p>
              Her potions usually remedy any unwanted behaviors, and when they don't...she always has her slipper. All other problems go into the ovens, or at least that's what's said to have happened to the last bad batch of her brood.
            </p>
            <p>
              For now, Mama's going out looking for something new. Something exciting. Something...dangerous.
