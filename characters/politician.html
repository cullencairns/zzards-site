            <p>
              A bureaucratic administrator on whom the whole world hinges. His signature on key documents will open the gates to the enemy, or close the coffers to the king. He doesn’t fight, he calls meetings on who’s allowed to fight.

            <h3>Origin Story</h3>
            <p>
              No one is quite sure if his position is elected, appointed, or inherited, but he's been in the system for so long that removing him from its works would require a new system.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nowadays the rest of the system finds it best to keep him happy, and do their business with his permission. After all, having him on their side makes their own endeavors that much more likely to make it past the labyrinth of bureaucratic red tape that he knows oh so well.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some have noticed his greedy little eyes are wandering, and his portfolio may be about to diversify. Those inside of his investing circle have begun to invest some of their money in new and exciting ventures.
